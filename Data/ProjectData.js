            Desc:'Presenting MindGarden AI, a user-friendly web application that assists with users’ mental wellbeing by utilizing positive affirmations, logging journals, and having a place to set their goals. A user can obtain both randomly generated affirmations and a guided affirmation based on an inputted problem they’re experiencing in order to help lift their spirits. In addition, users can track and set goals in improving their lives by utilizing the journal logs and a goal-tree. The app was developed by implementing next.js and flask. These frameworks would be for the app\'s frontend and backend, respectively. We first developed the logo and the images for the site using Adobe Express, and then began coding out the basic app. The affirmations are created by implementing GPT 3.5 using the OpenAI library. The AI is prompted and trained to create these affirmations in order to assist the user with their current mental wellbeing.',
